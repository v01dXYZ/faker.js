Marak, You're my hero.

A lot of people even the ones using the damn so called open-source libraries are fed up
with that free labor. As a maintainer, you've got to provide professional services on your
rest time, and as a employee of a company stripmining opensource software, you've got to get
into the internals of the tons of open-source dependencies if there is any problem, because guess
what the company can't afford to ask for support to the maintainers: here we useStackoverflow for the support, please fix this problem
by tomorrow morning by sending Github issues... @

Here it is a javascript library, but that's of course everywhere. For exemple, I'm currently dealing with Celery in Python. 
It is massively used by a lot of companies (as you can see on a lot of job boards) but there is only
a handful of maintainers. The original maintainer (Ask Solem) has litteraly pushed thousands of commits.
I'm glad she stopped because that was not fair for her.

I really want to tell them to go to hell with a much stronger language but they will use that against us.
We want them to understand the software don't get written/documented/architectured/integrated by itself, because of the Holy Spirit
but because we literally devote our time for it.

By flushing this repo, you resolved an arbitrage opportunity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage). That is the right thing to do.

United behind you we stand Marak. No more free lunch/beer, the show's over. Elvis has left the building.
